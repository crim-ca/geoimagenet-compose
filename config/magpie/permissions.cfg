#
# Parameters:
#   service:              service name to receive the permission (directly on it if no 'resource' mentioned, must exist)
#   resource (optional):  tree path of the service's resource (ex: /res1/sub-res2/sub-sub-res3)
#   user and/or group:    user/group to apply the permission on (user/group must exist)
#   permission:           name of the permission to be applied (see 'magpie/permissions.py' for supported values)
#   action:               one of [create, remove] (default: create)
#
# Default behaviour:
#   - create missing resources if supported by the service (and tree automatically resolvable), then apply permissions.
#   - create missing user/group if required (default user created: (group: anonymous, password: 12345).
#   - applicable service, user or group is missing, corresponding permissions are ignored and not updated.
#   - unknown actions are ignored and corresponding permission are not updated, unspecified action resolves to 'create'.
#   - already satisfied permission configurations are left as is.
